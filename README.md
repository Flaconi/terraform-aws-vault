This Terraform module provisions HashiCorp Vault with Consul Backend into an existing VPC including
an ELB with optionally a public Route53 DNS name fronting the Vault cluster.

## Usage example

```hcl
module "aws_vault" {
  source  = "github.com/Flaconi/terraform-aws-vault?ref=v0.1.0"

  # Placement
  vpc_id             = "vpc-1234"
  public_subnet_ids  = ["subnet-4321", "subnet-9876"]
  private_subnet_ids = ["subnet-1234", "subnet-5678"]

  # Resource Naming/Tagging
  name                = "vault"
  consul_cluster_name = "my-consul"
  vault_cluster_name  = "my-vault"

  # Security
  ssh_keys                 = ["ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nznte5aaCdi1a1Lzaai/tX6Mc2E+S6g3lrClL09iBZ5cW2OZdSIqomcMko 2 mysshkey"]
  ssh_security_group_id    = "sg-0c12345678"
  vault_ingress_cidr_https = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```
