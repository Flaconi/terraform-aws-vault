# This module has been copy/pasted from the following repository:
# https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul/tree/master/modules/consul-cluster
#
# Security groups have been re-written in order to make sure they are exclusively managed
# by Terraform and any other rules that have been added by hand (or other means) will be
# removed, whenever this module is called.
#
# This is achieved by moving all separately defined rules from 'aws_security_group_rule'
# into a single 'aws_security_group' block.

# CLARIFICATION OF SECURITY GROUPS: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/issues/107

# 1. Vault needs to allow inbound Consul connections. This is done by using the Consuls security
# group as destination in the vault "lc_security_group" rules.
# 2. Consul needs to allow inbound Vault connections. This is done by using the Vaults security
# group as destination in the consul "lc_security_group" rules.
#
# This however creates a circular dependency in Terraform, as both rules need to be created
# and linked to each other.
# In order to overcome this problem, each of the launch configurations attaches to an (almost)
# empty NULL security group that can be used by the other in their "lc_security_group" to act
# as destination.
# Once this behaviour is fixed in Terraform, each second security group will be removed.
# The "attach_security_group" represents the NULL security group that is also exported by this
# module in order to be used by security groups of other machines.
